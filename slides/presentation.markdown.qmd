## Introduction to R and RStudio

-   **R**: A programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
    -   Open-source, widely used in data analysis and research.
-   **RStudio**: An IDE for R (now part of Posit).
    -   Features: Code editor, package management, visualization tools, and Quarto integration.
-   **Why use them?**
    -   Free, extensible, and supported by a large community.
    -   Ideal for reproducible research and data science.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to Tidyverse

-   **Tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
-   Core packages include:
    -   `ggplot2`: Advanced data visualization.
    -   `dplyr`: Data manipulation (filtering, grouping, etc.).
    -   `tidyr`: Data tidying (reshaping datasets).
    -   `readr`: Fast data import.
    -   `purrr`: Functional programming tools.
    -   `tibble`: Enhanced data frames.
-   Focuses on "tidy" data principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tidyverse vs. R Base

-   **R Base**:
    -   Uses built-in functions (e.g., `subset()`, `merge()`).
    -   Syntax can be less consistent and harder to read.
    -   Suited for basic statistical tasks.
-   **Tidyverse**:
    -   Unified syntax with the pipe operator (`%>%` or `|>`) for chaining operations.
    -   Designed for tidy data (each column a variable, each row an observation).
    -   More intuitive for complex data workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages of Using Tidyverse

-   **Readability**: Pipe-based syntax makes code clear and sequential.
-   **Consistency**: Shared design philosophy across packages.
-   **Efficiency**: Simplifies common tasks like filtering, summarizing, and joining.
-   **Visualization**: `ggplot2` offers publication-quality graphics.
-   **Community Support**: Extensive tutorials, forums, and documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who Develops and Maintains Tidyverse?

-   **Developed by**: Posit (formerly RStudio), with key contributions from Hadley Wickham.
-   **Maintained by**:
    -   Posit team for core packages.
    -   Open-source contributors via GitHub.
-   **Updates**: Regular releases and new packages to address modern data needs.
-   **Community**: Engaged through Posit Community, R conferences, and online platforms.
